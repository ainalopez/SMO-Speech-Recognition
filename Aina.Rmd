# 3. SPEECH RECOGNIZER

We implemented a speech recognizer using a modified version of the DTW algorithm. Using DTW and speech processing techniques (i.e. Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients), our algorithm is able to detect which action we want to perform: open the google search or open our facebook webpage. 

This speech recognizer takes as input a sound file and compares it with some template words: *google* and *facebook*. In order to make our recognizer more robust, we have used two template words for each sound. After comparing the input sound with each template word, the algorithm chooses the one with the shortest path. 


## 3.1 Speech Processing

Since each sound has a different length, DTW is a good algorithm for comparing them. However, sound Waves are sinusoids and cannot be properly compared on the time domain (amplitude vs seconds). The reason is simple, a sound wave of a word can change radically from a person to another, and even the sound waves of a word generated by a single person can be very different.  

If we observe the sound waves of our sounds, we see their differences.

An extended approach is to transform the sound waves into the frequency domain and then, extract some coefficients. In this project, we tried with two different coefficients: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Prediction Coefficient (LPC). Unfortunately, we didn't obtained good results with LPC and we decided to use only MFCC. 

* Pre-emphasizing: In the process to digitalize audio, it passes through a low-pass filter and the high frequencies are attenuated. In this step a pre-emphasizing filter is applied to emphazise the higest frequenciy components of the speech, that is increase the energy in the higher frequencies.

* Framing: signals are not stationary, but small portions are. 

* Windowing: Apply a Hamming window to prevent discontinuity within frames.
